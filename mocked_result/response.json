  "message_context": "Hi John,\n\nThank you for attending the meeting today on the potential integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into your company’s workflows. It was insightful to explore how LLMs could enhance your customer service automation and streamline internal data processing.\n\nAs discussed, here are the next steps moving forward:\n- **Data Preparation**: We will need to assess the existing data sets to ensure they are compatible with the LLM training pipeline. Our data team will send over a data audit checklist by Thursday for your review.\n- **LLM Model Selection**: Based on your company’s needs, we recommend starting with GPT-4 for customer service and Google Gemini for internal knowledge management. We’ll schedule a call next Tuesday to discuss the specific capabilities of these models and align them with your business goals.\n- **Integration Timeline**: The initial phase of integration will begin by November 1st, focusing on a pilot deployment within your customer service chatbot. A detailed roadmap is attached outlining the major milestones and expected outcomes.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification before our next meeting. We’re excited to see how LLMs will transform your business operations!\n\nBest regards,\nWilfredo Sosa\nAI Solutions Architect at XYZ Innovations",
